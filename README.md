Add-on actions for Dropzone 3

Various click-able finder or safari features. All native  functions allready buildin to OSX. Expect nothing groundbreaking or 
fanzy coding. 
Basicly just  a droplet folder with links to other apps. Its Finder add-on with limit functionality.

A cross browser option would be nice. And scaleable dialog panels would be useful
