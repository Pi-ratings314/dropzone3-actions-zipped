# Dropzone 3 Actions Zipped

This repository contains a bunch of useful add-on actions that work with Dropzone 3. To install them you can clone this repository and double click on bundles to add them.

This repository is generated automatically each night from the [dropzone3-actions](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions) repository by zipping up all the bundles in that repository and renaming each zip file with a dzbundle extension. This makes the bundles easier to distribute because they are now single zip files rather than bundle directories. You should look at the [dropzone3-actions](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions) repository README for API documentation and further details.

You can link directly to the bundles from this repository and Dropzone 3 also uses it to perform updates by downloading the versions.txt file and re-downloading any that have a later version available than the one installed.
